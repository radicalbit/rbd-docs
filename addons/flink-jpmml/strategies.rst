Strategies
==========

Flink-JPMML's strategies are the mean the developer has to control the behaviour of a *Evaluation Operator*. When building a ``JPMMLEvaluationMapOperator`` or a ``JPMMLEvaluationFlatMapOperator`` you can specify many different strategies to customize parts of the evaluation process. Here are listed all the implemented strategies, grouped by their category. The developer is free to create their own strategies because they are intended as an entry point to manipulate *Evaluation Operators* in a safe and consistent way. 


Input preparation errors handling strategies
********************************************

These strategies let you handle exceptions raised during JPMML's preparation phase. They may be very different in nature and dependent on your PMML's file so there's no obvious way to deal with them.


Missing values strategies
*************************

JPMML and PMML standard allow for the specification of policies to deal with missing values. These are represented with a Java `null` in JPMML that except the possibility of `null` values during input preparation. At application level though, these missing values may be unexpected and if the developer is interested in handling them with a custom logic, he could implement its own missing value strategy.

Result extraction strategies
****************************

After the evaluation phase a raw result is produced by JPMML according to the specifications in the PMML file. This object may be parsed internally to the *Evaluation Operator* or forwarded to the following operator through the dedicated strategy.
