Set Up Service User Accounts
============================

Each |rbd-stack| service requires a service user account. The Ambari Install wizard creates new and preserves any existing service user accounts, and uses these accounts when configuring Hadoop services. Service user account creation applies to service user accounts on the local operating system and to LDAP/AD accounts.

For more information about customizing service user accounts for each |rbd-stack| service, see :doc:`Defining Service Users and Groups for a RBD Stack</ambari/administration/user-group>`.
